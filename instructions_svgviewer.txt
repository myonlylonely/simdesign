Instructions for building the svgviewer demo
============================================

compatible software to compile and build the demo:
Delphi7 - DelphiXE (only tested Delphi7 and DelphiXE)

* browse to \simlib\nativesvg\demos\svgviewer

* open svgviewer.dpr in the IDE. Note that you can use View > Project Manager to see the project.

* the demo should compile out of the box. If there are any problems, use the project manager to remove some references.

* run the viewer

* in the viewer, open file>load SVG

* open "tiger.svg"

* check out the other menus

Pyro Library
============
The Pyro library is rather extensive. This is the structure:

\simlib\pyro\source: 
This is the core library, and unit Pyro.pas holds all the lowlevel types, constants and global functions that all the other units need. These other units are named pg*.pas. Example: pgDocument.pas.

\simlib\pyro\source\gui:
Additional units that contain graphical user interface code. Example: pgVirtualScrollbox.pas

\simlib\nativexml: SimDesign's NativeXml component 

\simlib\nativejpg: SimDesign's NativeJpg component

\simlib\bitmap: SimDesign's (platform-independent) bitmap processing code

\simlib\nativesvg: SimDesign's actual SVG processing code

Some other folders hold files that are necessary for Pyro. The most noteworthy is:

\general\simdesign.inc: the global include file that with all the compiler defines for the different versions of Delphi (and FPC)

Happy coding!
